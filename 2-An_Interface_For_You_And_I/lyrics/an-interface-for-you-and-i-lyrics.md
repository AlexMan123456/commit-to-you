## Verse 1

Hello and welcome right here!  
I wanna give you the best experience!  
I'll be the one in the front!  
Leading the way to help things move smoothly!  
And if you need it more clear,  
I can read you out a description,  
So you'll be part of the fun,  
We'll be together, you and I, here together!


## Pre-chorus 1

I hope you feel good about the space we share, it's got a lovely view!
Let me know if you're comfortable in here, I'll adapt to you!
If there's something you need to say, I'll react with lots of care!
When the space is right for you then we'll put our plan right into action!


## Chorus

I'll listen out for you,  
If you update me about the state of you!  
When we communicate,  
We can do it using our shared language!  
Just lay the context out,  
And I'll help you one component at a time!  
Then through some time we'll build up  
An interface for you and I to connect!


## Verse 2

We're gonna build up our stack!  
Together we'll create lots of memories!  
We can explore 'round the scene!  
Those moments will be a part of our history!  
And if you wanna go back,  
We can go back to where we left off!  
And I'll make sure you feel seen,  
We'll be together, you and I, here together!


## Pre-chorus 2

If you feel that you just aren't ready yet, I will wait for you!
Just tell me how you think you're feeling and I will give you room!
If you feel that there's something wrong, then I'll try to understand!
When the time is right for you then we'll put our plan right into action!


## Chorus

I'll listen out for you,  
If you update me about the state of you!  
When we communicate,  
We can do it using our shared language!  
Just lay the context out,  
And I'll help you one component at a time!  
Then through some time we'll build up  
An interface for you and I to connect!
