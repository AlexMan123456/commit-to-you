# Commit To You

### Verse 1

I know you’ve been checking me out,  
Shall we take it to the next level now?  
‘Cause I really wanna be there all for you,  
All for you!  
Come on now, let’s make a fresh start!  
Pin my number, then you can take me out!  
While I go and build up my courage for you,  
All for you!

### Pre-chorus 1
Although our calendars are imperfect, at best,  
I’d like to organise time with you! (with you!).  
Just tell me when and I’ll make it clear,  
All clear for you,  
All clear for you!  
(One, two, three, go!)

### Chorus
I wanna be of utility, I’ll help you on the run!  
I’ll be the one here in the back, while you go have some fun!  
Looking out for you tonight, I’ll be the one you can rely on!  
Watch you go and watch me pass by,  
I’ll be here!  
I’ll commit to you!

### Verse 2
Though sometimes it won’t be easy,  
You’ll be here to bring out the best in me,  
And I’ll hold myself to high standards for you!  
All for you!  
We’ll grow as a pair, you and me,  
We’ll build up a healthy dependency,  
You can build with me and I’ll develop with you!  
I’m with you!

### Pre-chorus 2
I’ll be with you when you’re up or you’re down,  
We’ll deal with all our problems together (together!)  
Just tell me what you want, I’ll make it clear,  
All clear for you,  
All clear for you!  
(One, three, one, go!)

### Chorus
I wanna be of utility, I’ll help you on the run!  
(help you on the run!)  
I’ll be the one here in the back, while you go have some fun!  
(you go have some fun!)  
Looking out for you tonight, I’ll be the one you can rely on!  
Watch you go and watch me pass by,  
I’ll be here!  
I’ll commit to you!

### Bridge
Looking into our stack!  
I'll commit to you!  
We've got a `NAMESPACE_EXPORT_REGEX`!  
I'll commit to you!  
`export\s+\*\s+from`  
I'll commit to you!  
`const VERSION_NUMBER_REGEX: string!`  
I'll commit to you!

`^(?:v)?(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)$`  
I'll commit to you!  
Oh, this feels all so right!  
I'll commit to you!  
throw new DataError(
      radix ? { string, radix } : string,
      "INTEGER_PARSING_ERROR",
      `Only numeric values${radix && radix > 10 && radix <= 36 ? ` or character${radix !== 11 ? "s" : ""} A${radix !== 11 ? `-${maxAllowedAlphabeticalCharacter?.toUpperCase()} ` : " "}` : " "}are allowed.`,
    ); stopping us now!  
I'll commit to you!  
Let's show them
type DisallowUndefined<InputType> = undefined extends InputType
  ? ["Error: Generic type cannot include undefined"]
  : InputType;  
v2.3.4, go!

### Final Chorus
I wanna be of utility, I’ll help you on the run!  
(help you on the run!)  
I’ll be the one here in the back, while you go have some fun!  
(you go have some fun!)  
Looking out for you tonight, I’ll be the one you can rely on!  
Watch you go and watch me pass by,  
I’ll be here!  
I’ll commit to you!

I wanna be of utility, I’ll help you on the run!
