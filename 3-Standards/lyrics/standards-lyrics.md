# Standards

### Verse 1

Think you're ready to push and show?  
I've found problems you'd better know!  
People think that I'm too picky.  
But I just guard the gates of quality!

### Pre-chorus

Sort those objects!  
Check that spelling!  
I just wanna get you to your best!  
Missing symbol!  
Check that spacing!  
Put your work to the test!  

### Chorus

I'm checking! I'm checking!  
Checking for no mistyped things!  
I'm checking! I'm checking!  
Making sure your work's all in order!  
I'm checking! I'm checking!  
You sure this is your best work?  
I just do this 'cause I care and,  
I have standards, you'd better have some too!

### Verse 2

Now we've got to define some rules!  
You can pick and I'll check for you!  
Even if they aren't what I'd use,  
Make sure you follow them the whole way through!

### Pre-chorus 2

Set your standards!  
Figure out your style!  
Choose the rules that will help give your best!  
Be consistent!  
I'll still check it!  
And put your work to the test!

### Chorus

I'm checking! I'm checking!  
Checking for no mistyped things!  
I'm checking! I'm checking!  
Making sure your work's all in order!  
I'm checking! I'm checking!  
You sure this is your best work?  
I just do this 'cause I care that,  
You have standards, and I will follow them!

I'm checking! I'm checking!  
Checking for no mistyped things!  
I'm checking! I'm checking!  
Making sure your work's all in order!  
I'm checking! I'm checking!  
You sure this is your best work?  
I just do this 'cause I care that,  
You have standards, I'll help you follow 'em too!

### Final Chorus

I'm checking! I'm checking!  
Checking for no mistyped things!

Making sure your work's all in order!  
I'm checking! I'm checking!  
You sure this is your best work?  
I just do this 'cause I care that,  
You have standards, and I will follow them!
