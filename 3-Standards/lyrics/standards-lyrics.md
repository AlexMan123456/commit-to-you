# Standards

### Verse 1

Think you're ready to push and show?  
I've found problems you'd better know!  
People think that I'm too picky.  
But I just guard the gates of quality!

### Pre-chorus



### Chorus

I'm checking! I'm checking!  
Checking for no mistyped things!  
I'm checking! I'm checking!  
Making sure your work's all in order!  
I'm checking! I'm checking!  
You sure this is your best work?  
I just do this 'cause I care and,  
I have standards, you'd better have some too!
