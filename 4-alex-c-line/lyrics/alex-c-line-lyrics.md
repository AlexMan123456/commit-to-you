# alex-c-line

## Verse 1

alex-c-line, here to help you at your command!
You can go install me in!
Here in your system or here in your project space!
Say my name and I'll assist!
I can take care of the tasks of monotony!
Run those three scripts all at once!
I hope that you feel a boost in efficiency!
Call me if you need my help!
My name is...

## Chorus

Alex-c-line!
Brings info right to your console!
Alex-c-line!
Run tasks for you in the background!
Alex-c-line!
I'll be at hand,
when you say...
Alex-c-line run command!

## Verse 2

I'll bring you templates to help you mark down a plan,
Document all of your work!
I'll help you calculate what the next version from here will be,
Make them aware what will work!
I can help you to prepare before you commit!
Tell me the checks I should run!
When you feel ready to show the world what you've done,
We'll tag and run a deploy!
When you're ready, call me...

## Chorus

Alex-c-line!
Brings info right to your console!
Alex-c-line!
Run tasks for you in the background!
Alex-c-line!
I'll be at hand,
when you say...
Alex-c-line run command!
So call me...

Alex-c-line!
Brings info right to your console!
Alex-c-line!
Run tasks for you in the background!
Alex-c-line!
I'll be at hand,
when you say...
Alex-c-line run command!
