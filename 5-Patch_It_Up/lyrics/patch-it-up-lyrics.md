# Patch It Up

### Intro

(Clean guitar arpeggios)  
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!**

### Verse 1

Looking up at my screen, there is a big red cross!  
I can't figure it out, now I am at a loss!  
Oh wait, I've found it out, you won't believe the fix!  
Turns out that package wasn't using the latest version!  
But now I've found it out, running the pre-commit!  
To get it passing took longer than I'll admit!  
I checked it thoroughly, checking all the syntax!  
Now time to push my code, hoping that I won't have to...

### Pre-chorus

**PATCH IT UUUUUUUP!**  
**PATCH IT UUUUUUUP!**  

### Chorus

Now to face the workflow of the damned!  
I'm gonna push my changes to the branch!  
See how the action's gonna act!  
And it says, **PATCH IT UP NOW!**  
I just want my change to be deployed!  
The runner's making my blood wanna boil!  
But since I misplaced dot-and-slash!  
I've gotta **PATCH IT UP NOW!**

### Post-chorus

Checkout repo, setup package!  
**PATCH! IT! UUUUUUUP!**  
Build, formatting, linting, testing!  
**PATCH! IT! UUUUUUUP!**  
Fetch the docs and change the version!  
**PATCH! IT! UUUUUUUP!**  
Merge the changes, start deploying!  
**PATCH! IT! UUUUUUUP!**  

### Verse 2

The change has been merged in, workflow scheduled for nine,  
I hope by then the workflow will fire up on time!  
After a few more hours, I check on it again!  
Turns out the timezone isn't set to my local time now!   
Well, nevermind, I'm gonna add a workflow dispatch!  
So I can test it, though it feels like an escape hatch!  
And once it's run it's gonna update dependencies,  
Put up a pull request that's gonna yell right at me to...
