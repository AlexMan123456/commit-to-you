# Patch It Up

### Chorus

Now to face the workflow of the damned!  
I'm gonna push my changes to the branch!  
See how the action's gonna act!  
And it says, **PATCH IT UP NOW!**  
I just want my change to be deployed!  
The runner's making my blood wanna boil!  
But since I misplaced dot-and-slash!  
I've gotta **PATCH IT UP NOW!**

### Post-chorus

Checkout repo, setup package!  
**PATCH! IT! UUUUUUUP!**  
Build, formatting, linting, testing!  
**PATCH! IT! UUUUUUUP!**  
Fetch the docs and change the version!  
**PATCH! IT! UUUUUUUP!**  
Merge the changes, publish package!  
**PATCH! IT! UUUUUUUP!**
